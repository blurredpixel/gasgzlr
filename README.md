# GasGzlr: Simple MPG Tracking

## About

This application is quite simple. You input your tank gallons that you filled-up at the gas station, and you put in your trip odometer reading.

## Technologies

This application uses the PYODBC driver connecting to a MSSQL server. It is served with Flask as a dyanmic front-end. Bokeh is the visualization library.
